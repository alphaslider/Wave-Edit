# Wave-Edit
Sample Edit and Chopping Utility,

🎹 Precision Loop Chopper & Zoomv1.0.0 // The "Micro-Surgery" ModuleThis utility is a high-precision audio editor designed for the preparation of samples before they are loaded into the MEGAMICRODAW sequencer. It focuses on solving the "click" problem in loops through automated zero-crossing detection.🛠 Features & LogicZero-Crossing Snap: When a selection is made, the engine automatically searches a ±128 sample range to find the quietest point ($0$ amplitude). This prevents the "pops" and "clicks" typically heard in poorly cut loops.Dynamic Zoom: Up to 50x magnification. The render() function recalculates the visual "envelope" (min/max peaks) based on the zoom level to maintain performance.Destructive Editing: Includes TRIM (keep only selection) and CUT (remove selection and stitch ends together).WAV Re-Encoding: A custom audioBufferToWav function builds a 16-bit PCM header from scratch, allowing edited loops to be exported back to the local file system.⚠️ Current LimitationsBeing aware of these prevents "Context Rot" when integrating this into the main DAW.Memory Overhead: The historyStack stores raw AudioBuffer copies. Since it keeps up to 5 undos, high-resolution 5-minute samples could quickly consume 500MB+ of browser RAM.Single Channel View: While the engine supports stereo files, the visualizer currently only renders the first channel (Channel 0).Mono-Trigger UI: Like the main DAW, the playhead logic is "hard mono"—restarting the playhead immediately kills the previous voice.Visual Desync: At extreme zoom levels (50x), the cursor interpolation relies on requestAnimationFrame, which may jitter if the browser tab is under high CPU load.🚀 Future Improvements1. Workflow & Usability"Send to DAW" Bridge: Instead of Export -> Save -> Load in DAW, add a window.postMessage hook to send the edited AudioBuffer directly into a selected track in the MEGAMICRODAW window.Selection Handles: Currently, you have to redraw the selection if you miss by a few pixels. Adding "drag-handles" on the left and right of the selection box would increase speed.Keyboard Shortcuts:Z / X: Quick zoom in/out.Shift + Left/Right: Nudge selection by 10ms.Enter: Execute Trim.2. Technical RoadmapWorker-Based Rendering: Move the waveform peak calculation into a Web Worker. This would allow the UI to remain 60FPS even when loading 1-hour long audio files.Fade In/Out Tool: Add a 2ms automatic "Micro-Fade" at the start and end of every TRIM or CUT to guarantee silence even if a zero-crossing isn't found.Spectrogram View: Add a toggle to see frequency density, which is helpful for finding the exact "hit" of a snare or kick drum within a loop.
